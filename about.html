        Most of my work includes using Web browsers and lot, and whichever one I use I cannot 
        help but open a new tab and head to youtube.com or twitter.com, it is just a habit.

        <br> 
        <br> 
        Thanks to a chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en" target="_blank">News Feed Eradicator</a>, I was able to get rid of this bad habit
        by now making the entire feed hidden, each time I'd open a new tab, I'd see a blank feed and it just killed my habit. 

        <br>

        Problem was, this extension was not available for Safari, and I was not able to find any other and so I 
        decided to make one myself. And, here we are. 

        <br> 
        <br> 

        The reason why it has to exist on Safari is because if you have a Mac, Safari works the best 
        and is very easy on the battery as well. I hope this small project is able to serve you well.
